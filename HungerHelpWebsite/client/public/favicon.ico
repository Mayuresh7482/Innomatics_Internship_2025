This is a placeholder for the favicon.ico file.

In an actual implementation, this would be an ICO file containing the Hunger Help logo icon.
The favicon would be a simplified version of the main logo that works well at small sizes.

For deployment, replace this placeholder with an actual favicon.ico file, which should include
multiple resolutions (16x16, 32x32, 48x48) for different browser and operating system needs.
