This is a placeholder for the 512x512 logo image file.

In an actual implementation, this would be a PNG image file with the Hunger Help logo.
The logo would typically include:
- The "Hunger Help" name or initials
- A food or charity-related icon (such as a plate, hand, or heart)
- The brand colors (primary color scheme)

This larger version would be used for higher-resolution displays and PWA installation.
For deployment, replace this placeholder with an actual image file of 512x512 pixels.
